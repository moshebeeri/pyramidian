I would like you to create a 3d html and javascript web page to simulate the build the large pyramid of Egypt.
Now there are many theories false theories of the build of the pyramids that are not supported by science nor for the ability of humans to operate under the physics laws.
For example the standard pictures of hundreds of slaves pulling the stones up the slope with rolling logs belows the the stone, its impractical.
The way I think is was built and its supported by evidence are the fact that the stones covered with layers of bundles of local papirus lives made the stone to float to have just a bit of it over the the water surface, this way the stones transferred to a pool curved to the pyramid.
The elevation of the stone to the upper pool (at the first layer it way strait forward, but from that to the second layer the builders have build a water pilar contained from all side and having an entry point and a cover to release it to float.
this way the builders should only "pupmt" relatively primitive jar based pump to cover evaporation and lost water over bad isolations. and as the pool would  go up its volume will go down wilt the water will go up when the builders release the floating cover, by archimedes law.
Please generate a simulation of this process using top javascript 3D library, make sure all in one file





I would like to have the steps running automatically and I would like to control the speed, pulling to zero will show a button for next step.
In the meanwhile also fix this issue.
Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token (at code.html:104:76)
This is the line
const groundMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x sandybrown, side: THREE.DoubleSide });



the water pilar  should of been internal to the pyramid, the water pool should always be on the last plan that is been build.imagine it as a scff holter on the conture.
the stones would go into a (hirizontal tunnel 0 ground) tunnel floating to the center of the pyramid where the pillar elevator is.
that the worker would close the side valve and opens the up valve to float the brick up.
Please also improve the simulation by starting from zero ground with only contoured pool.
If you have difficulties to implement the simulation, construct a multi steps plans and implement the simulation in multiple cycles.
